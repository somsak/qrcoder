<h3><center>How to scan</center></h3>
<p>QRCoder continuously scans a square region shown on your screen &mdash; just line up the
  phone so the QR Code is completely inside the viewfinder rectangle:</p>

<p>When a QR Code is read, a beep sound will play and you'll see the results of the scan, a
  description of what the QR Code contains, and options to take action on the contents.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble scanning, make sure to hold the phone steady. If the camera is unable to
  focus, try moving the phone further or closer from the QR Code.</p>
